# **Case Study Questions**

## **A. Customer Journey**

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table (`customer_id` `1`, `2`, `11`, `13`, `15`, `16`, `18` and `19`), write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.  
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

### **Data Selection SQL Query**
````sql
select customer_id, 
       plan_name, 
       start_date, 
       timestampdiff(day, lag(start_date) over (partition by customer_id order by start_date), start_date) as days_after_joining 
from subscriptions 
join plans using (plan_id) 
where customer_id in (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19);
````
